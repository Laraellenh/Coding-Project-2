# Partner-Coding-Project-1


In this single page web app, there are 6 gifs displayed. When you click on each one, the mood is named and a biochemical fact about your brain is also shared relating to that emotion. The DOM content loads first, so the page should run quickly. 

You will be able to like a gif to show how you are currently feeling.

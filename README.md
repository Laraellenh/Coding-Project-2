In this single page web app, there are 6 gifs displayed. When you click on each one, the mood is named and a biochemical fact about your brain is also shared relating to that emotion. The DOM content loads first, so the page should run quickly.
You will be able to like a gif to show how you are currently feeling.
In order to access the data on this website, install the json server if you don't aleady have it.
 npm install -g json-server
